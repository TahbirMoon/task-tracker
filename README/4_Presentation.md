**Project Name**: Task Tracker  
**Student**: Tahbir Ahmed Moon

## 🎯 Project Overview

The **Task Tracker** is a simple, full-stack web application that allows users to manage personal to-do tasks. Users can add, complete, delete, and edit tasks. This project was developed in four phases throughout the course using Node.js, Express, SQLite, and vanilla JavaScript. The application runs locally and provides a smooth, interactive experience.

---

## ✅ Planned Use Cases (from Phase 1)

1. Add a new task  
2. Mark a task as completed  
3. Delete a task  
4. Edit an existing task  

All of the above use cases have been successfully implemented. The **Edit Task** feature was added in Phase 3 as a further development.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Connecting frontend to backend using REST API  
- Handling fetch requests (POST, PUT, DELETE)  
- Keeping the UI state synced with the backend  
- Fixing CORS and async DOM update issues  
- Structuring a full-stack project in clear phases  
- Implementing feature improvements based on feedback (Edit Task)

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Replace `prompt()` in Edit Task with a proper modal or form  
- Add authentication for multiple users  
- Use a hosted or cloud database instead of local SQLite  
- Improve UI design using a framework like Bootstrap  
- Deploy the app publicly on platforms like Deno Deploy or Railway
